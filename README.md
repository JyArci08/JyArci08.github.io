(How I accomplished each item in the criteria)
- Essentially, in meeting the requirements of the first and last criteria, I achieved the application of concepts by exploring various materials provided by Sir Job. Among these materials, the most notable was a lengthy YouTube video guiding the step-by-step creation of a responsive website. Subsequently, I fulfilled the second criterion by actively searching for examples of websites. I gathered ideas from my findings and implemented them.

Transitioning to the third and fourth criteria, I successfully addressed them through my own thought process. I have always enjoyed creating something that involves art or creativity. Fortunately, my creativity not only enhanced the visual appeal of my website but also ensured that the content I presented complemented the overall design seamlessly.

(Insights that I have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2)
- From working on our lab assignments, I've learned that they're not too hard, as long as you put in the effort to understand them. It won't be easy if you just sit back and do nothing. You have to explore and learn to make things easier. It's like solving a puzzle â€“ each piece you figure out makes the whole picture clearer. By being curious and actively trying to understand, you not only make the tasks more enjoyable but also realize that they're not as complicated as they seem. It's about being curious and trying to learn rather than just waiting around.

(Struggles that I have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2)
- The challenges I faced in completing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 primarily stemmed from my lack of familiarity with the syntax or code needed to execute the ideas I had in mind. This difficulty was compounded by the fact that working with HTML, CSS, and JS is a relatively new experience for me, and I'm currently in the process of learning and familiarizing myself with these technologies.

(How I could improve your website in the future)
- To make my website better in the future, I think the first step is to spend more time learning about HTML, CSS, JS, and other important coding languages. By understanding these languages better, I can do more cool things on my website, make it look nicer, and give visitors a smoother experience.

I also want to explore other tools and languages that can add new features to my website. Learning and keeping up with the latest in web development will help me adapt my site to what people expect and include new and interesting stuff.

In simple terms, I want to get better at the basics and also try out new things to make my website cooler and more enjoyable for everyone who visits.

I've found it interesting to tackle the different challenges that come with each task, figuring out how to make things work and look good. It's like solving little puzzles, and there's a sense of accomplishment when everything comes together.

Creating this website has been an enjoyable journey as well. Designing how it looks, adding features, and making it unique has been a creative process that I've genuinely liked. It's not just about coding; it's about expressing ideas and making something that feels personal and interesting.

In a nutshell, working on these tasks and building the website has been a mix of curiosity, problem-solving, and creativity that I've found both intriguing and genuinely enjoyable.
